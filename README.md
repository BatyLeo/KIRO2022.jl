This repository contains a Julia starting code for the 2022 edition of the KIRO.

A Python version can also be found in the `python` [folder](https://github.com/BatyLeo/KIRO2022.jl/tree/main/python) as a Jupyter notebook.

A c++ version can be found in the `c++` [folder](https://github.com/BatyLeo/KIRO2022.jl/tree/main/c++).

Instances are in the `instances` [folder](https://github.com/BatyLeo/KIRO2022.jl/tree/main/instances).

## Installation

You need to have julia v1.7 or higher already installed to use this package.

To install, run the following code in a Julia REPL:
```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/BatyLeo/KIRO2022.jl")

julia> using KIRO2022
```

Now, some utility functions are available for getting started easily with the challenge.

Checkout the [documentation](https://batyleo.github.io/KIRO2022.jl/) for details on how to use them.

**Note**: alternatively, you can also just download the Julia source code of this repository and use it/modify it for your needs in your code without using the `KIRO2022` package.
